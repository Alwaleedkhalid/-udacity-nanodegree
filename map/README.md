### Project Overview:

Develop a single page application featuring a map of a neighborhood you would like to visit. Add additional functionality to this map including highlighted locations, third-party data about those locations and various ways to browse the content.


### Project Details
In this project, we list the places to visit in New Delhi, India.
The project has a bootstrap navbar that includes the search box to search all the locations.
A location dropdown that lists all the locations marked on the map. The dropdown also opens up whenever something is typed on the search box.
A button named Show Listing that shows all the listing on the map
A button named Hide listings which hides all the listings and the markers on the map when clicked.
A button named Drawing tools which when clicked enables the drawing tools on the map.
The map is loaded asynchronously.
